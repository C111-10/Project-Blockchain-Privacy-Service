# Project-Blockchain-Privacy-Service

The general Premise of this project is to create a blockchain network that provides incentives to all users. Miners (enabling the operation of the service via a proof of work validation system for data acquisition at the users-end) the user whos data is securley interlaced into the data chain - Being a chain of blocks that will contain all historical data that has been encoded into the data chain by users via use of service.

Users have never been given power over their data. This service will give users complete power over their data; whether to hide it completely or sell it themselves or as part of pools! Advertisers and Data buyers are given specialised access to the data blocks they purchase. The miners provide computational effort for the functionality of the network to allow the privacy features and be compensated with a percentage of the data value purchased by data buyers in the native tokens.

# User side


# The System architecture

THe network will consist of a bloockchain housing all the user data acquired into said blockchain. This Genesis block will be secured via the proof of work algorithm. A virtual proxy network within the chain will allow this to
